# MiCADO

MiCADO (Microservices-based Cloud Application-level Dynamic Orchestrator) is a generic pluggable framework that supports optimal and secure deployment and run-time orchestration of cloud applications. 

The COLA project [1] will provide a reference implementation of this framework by customising and extending existing, typically open source solutions. Moreover, it will demonstrate via large scale close to operational level SME and public sector demonstrators the applicability and impact of the solution.
